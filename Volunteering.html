      <p>I volunteer in national speedcubing competitions taking place in the Dominican Republic as a Staff taking roles as runner and judge. The sport brings a safe environment for children and young adults to exercise their mental abilities and compete against themselves, and at the same time develop a healthy and rewarding hobby.</p>
