  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The customer experience and success fields are ones that I hold very close to my heart.</p>
  <p>I've gathered more than 5 years of total experience in customer-facing roles for US and UK companies. During 1 of those years, I have worked as a support regional team lead of 20 agents worldwide. I also had the opportunity to work with compliance at an international level, checking companies' legitimacy and individuals from all over the world. I also enjoy creating and clearly outlining new processes and shaping old ones.</p>
  <p>I have demonstrated to be a highly motivated and hardworking individual who can offer excellent customer service, time management and organization skills. In terms of my academic background, I have a degree in MSc in Investment and Finance from Middlesex University, a BSc in Economics from SUNY Empire State College and a BA in International Business from Universidad APEC.</p>
